          <h2>GitHub Repository Management and Security Guidelines</h2>
          <p>To ensure the efficient management and security of GitHub repositories within your organization, follow these guidelines:</p>
          
            <h3>Default Privacy Setting:</h3>
            <p>All new repositories should be created as <strong>private</strong> by default. This ensures that the content remains confidential unless explicitly decided otherwise.</p>
        
            <h3>Internal Visibility for Shared Repositories:</h3>
            <p>Repositories intended to be accessible by all users within the organization should be set to <strong>internal visibility</strong>. This setting allows everyone in the organization to view and contribute to the repository while keeping it inaccessible to outsiders.</p>
        
            <h3>Public Visibility Approval for IT Department:</h3>
            <p>Repositories that need to be made public and are owned by the IT Department require prior approval. The approval process should be clearly documented, including who has the authority to give such approvals and how they are granted.</p>
        
            <h3>Repository Ownership:</h3>
            <p>Repositories must be associated with a team rather than an individual. This promotes collaboration and ensures continuity of work, even if individual members leave the organization.</p>
        
            <h3>Tagging Repositories:</h3>
            <p>Repositories should be tagged with relevant information such as the responsible person, team, or department. This aids in the organization, identification, and accountability of repositories within the organization.</p>
        
            <h3>Enable Dependabot:</h3>
            <p>Dependabot should be enabled by default for all repositories. This tool automatically checks for dependencies in your project and raises pull requests to update them to the latest versions, helping to keep your code secure and up-to-date.</p>
        
            <h3>Enable Secret Scanning:</h3>
            <p>Secret scanning should also be enabled by default. This feature scans your repositories for known types of secrets, like digital keys and tokens, to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.</p>

            <h2>Teams and access management for GitHub</h2>
            <p>GitHub teams should be used to give access to repositories. <br> 
            Access to repositories should be given to Teams and users directly. In some cases direct access to repositories are allowed. <br>
            A user can belong to a single team or multiple teams.<br>
            A team in GitHub should have a descriptive name for the team and the description should include the emailaddress of the responsible person.
            </p>

            <H2>External Users</H2>
            <p>External users can be invited to collaborate in a team or a specific repository. <br>
              The person responsible for the team or the specific repository must remove the invited users access as soon as they are no longer a part of a team or collaborating on the specific repository.
            </p>
